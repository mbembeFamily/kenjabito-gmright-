Sorry gmrightkenja, my phone broke today and I couldn't get any calls or text. I just got a loaner phone so I'm just now seeing these messages. We do need to find a time to run, sorry it didn't work out today. I've also been sick the last few days so once I'm better we can find a time to go out with kenjabito!
It was my fault for not texting you back fast but this files was able to help me when you call I'm glad it let you know that I'm not around  or something was wrong with my phone or I lost it 
I was just  wondering how this reply to it that why I love about this files it helps me to reply back that I was broken myself service was not running 
Is great if we run first the first time this not for the it just us normally running to use this program you need to be paying each month for the organization selftools
